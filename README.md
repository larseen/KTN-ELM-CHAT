KTN-ELM-CHAT
===========

KTN-ELM-CHAT is what is suggests, a chat. The chat is implemented in java, using sockets for connections between entities and JSON-objects for sending information. The rest as they say is history.

Oh, and the chat will be written in norwegian (NOT)

## Usage

#### Start server on port 3462
```
java -jar elm-server.jar 3462
```


#### Start client on IP 'localhost' with port 3462
```
java -jar elm-client.jar localhost 3462
```

## Prospects

Next week, maybe our chat will look like this?
